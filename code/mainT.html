		<h1>Hello! Welcome to my first website!</h1>
		
		<p>Before starting my final project for Embedded Linux I had no prior knowledge
		of web-programming. All I knew was a decent amount of java<br> along with some C and
		little C++, however during the course of this project I've learned quite a bit.
		For starters I've learned a lot about the<br> general structure of html, as well as 
		how universal a lot of its formatting is. On top of (or rather within) html I 
		gained some experience with<br> javascript. Unfortunately I can't say I've written 
		any of my own, but why do that when others have so kindly shared their own code
		on sources<br> such as GitHub. In the end my site may not be the prettiest thing, or
		anywhere near the most well done, but I enjoyed working on it and look<br> forward to
		more web-programming in the future.
		</p>
